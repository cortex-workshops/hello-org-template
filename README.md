# Hello Org Cookiecutter Template

This repository provides a minimal template for creating a **Hello World** project.  
It is intended to be used as part of a **Cortex Getting Started workflow** to quickly scaffold a starter repository for new developers.

## What It Generates

When this template is used, it creates a new repository with:

<repo_name>/
├── README.md
└── hello_org.py

- `hello_org.py` — a simple Python script that prints `"Hello, World!"`.
- `README.md` — basic instructions for cloning the repo and running the script.

## Inputs

- `repo_name` – the name of the new repository (provided automatically by Cortex in the onboarding workflow).

## Outputs

- A ready-to-clone Hello World repo where the developer can run:

  ```bash
  python hello_org.py
and see:
Hello, World!
